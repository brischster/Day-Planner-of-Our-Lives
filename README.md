# Day-Planner-of-Your-Lives

Schedule planner for your daily activities

## Overview

Create a program that a user is able to input their different to-do items for different hours of the day. They are able to save them, so that they stay on the page each time they come back until they either delete it or change it to a new task.

The calendar also changes the color of each column passed on the time of the day. If they time is in the past it is grey background, the current hour will be in red and future hours are in green.
